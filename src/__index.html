	<h1>UIBUILDER for Node-RED, Svelte Template Example</h1>

    <p>
        If you are seeing this page, you have not changed the default
        "Serve" setting in the uibuilder node in Node-RED.
    </p>
    <p>
        It defaults to serving from the <code>src/</code> folder.
        But Svelte is a build-only framework so you need to switch to
        the <code>dist/</code> folder which is where the built process
        outputs its files.
